1
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:20,854
<i>They're taking fire from the woods.
They're waiting for the tanks.</i>

2
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:24,357
<i>Enemy fire from our right flank.
I say again, our right flank.</i>

3
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,415
<i>Princess Red 6 for Culture.</i>

4
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>Hold fast. This is the
worst of it, boys. Over.</i>

5
00:00:35,977 --> 00:00:37,587
<i>Sergeant Humphrey just showed up.</i>

6
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:40,790
<i>Have you any information
on the right flank?</i>

7
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:44,627
<i>Culture, that's a negative. Move.</i>

8
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>This is Able 2. The 88 is in that church.
They threw one at us when we drove by.</i>

9
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>Negative. It's all over!</i>

10
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,407
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

11
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:19,120
<i>Do you read me? Do you read me?</i>

12
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:34,315
Son of a bitch!

13
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,701
Did you get that fucker?

14
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:49,205
Knocked him off.

15
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,387
Gordo, stop. Leave him rest.

16
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:07,932
Gordo, he's dead.

17
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:13,396
He's dead! Show some respect.
Leave him alone.

18
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,118
He's your fault!

19
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,236
God damn it. Ain't you done yet?

20
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:23,582
You got no right to be fucking sore
with me. Quit fucking riding me.

21
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:26,618
I ain't riding you.
If I was riding you, you'd know it.

22
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,244
More where he came from.

23
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,747
Hey, fuck you, Don!
It's your fucking fault we here.

24
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,083
Are you still talking?
Let's get out of here.

25
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:36,261
Fuck! What the fuck you do that for?

26
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:38,263
- I'm trying to fix it!
- You know why.

27
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:41,633
You want to fucking whup me?
It ain't gonna fucking help anything!

28
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:44,728
Probate, Fox 6.

29
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,147
I say, why you always whupping on me?

30
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:50,775
'Cause you're an animal, a dog.
All you understand is the fist and boot.

31
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,736
Don, I'm telling you right now,
don't fucking call me that.

32
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,771
I ain't a fucking animal.
I ain't a fucking dog.

33
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,325
<i>Vámonos, cabrón. Vámonos.</i>

34
00:05:56,425 --> 00:06:00,076
Hey, you want to talk Mexican,
join another tank, a Mexican tank.

35
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:02,370
This is an American tank,
we talk American.

36
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,374
Who put the fucking nickel in you, Top?
You talk Kraut!

37
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,293
You talk German! I can't talk Spanish?

38
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:09,920
- Bible, what country we in?
- Germany.

39
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,871
Germany, they speak German.

40
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:16,301
- Could you explain to him it's a tool of war?
- It's a tool of war, Gordo.

41
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,461
Here's my tool of war.

42
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:19,638
Top.

43
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:23,883
You knew German before we got in this
fucking war! Don't play stupid with me.

44
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,761
I expect all of you to
pull your shit together.

45
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:31,683
I wish you'd stop ragging on everyone.
You didn't kill Red, Germans did.

46
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,519
That is true, but I
didn't save him, either.

47
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:38,782
His number came up, that's all.
We've been lucky till now.

48
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:41,451
- We've been lucky?
- Yes, sir.

49
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,896
- We're all alive. We're in here.
- God's grace?

50
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,299
Rain's coming.

51
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,057
Coon-Ass, anytime, sweetheart.

52
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,818
I'm your sweetheart, right?

53
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,655
Okay. Gordo, crank her up.

54
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:24,027
- Choke her up. She's cold.
- There's condensation on the plugs.

55
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,447
Fuckers!

56
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,786
All right, move out. Get us out of here.

57
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,210
- Bible, gun front.
- Roger.

58
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:32,489
Come on, move it!

59
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:35,975
Get those cases out of here!

60
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:49,072
I thought you were dead.

61
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,270
- Devil watches over his own. Binkowski.
- Good to see you.

62
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,180
Don, glad you made it back.

63
00:09:57,414 --> 00:09:59,649
Crew still together? Nate? Lindburgh?

64
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:00,892
Doing well.

65
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,520
Good.

66
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:09,743
- Grab his arm.
- Here you go.

67
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,161
Okay.

68
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:12,821
Lay him down. Lay him down.

69
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,698
Move.

70
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,661
Set him down soft.

71
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:24,541
Sergeant.

72
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,211
Sergeant.

73
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:31,047
Lift.

74
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,262
Where's the rest of Third Platoon?

75
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,558
We're it.

76
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,865
Hey, Boyd?

77
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:52,410
Hey, Boyd, they...
They gonna send him home, right?

78
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,912
I don't know that, Grady.

79
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:59,600
Red's got us all a little sad right now,
but we got a job to do.

80
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:04,330
Grady, restock ammo and rations.
Gordo, water and gas.

81
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:07,717
Boyd, get some chow and do what you can
about the mechanical issues.

82
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:11,254
We can't do shit about mechanical issues.
Where you going?

83
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,520
First Sergeant Collier?

84
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,765
- Maybe. What the fuck are you?
- Private Ellison.

85
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:07,686
I was told to report to you.
I'm your new assistant driver.

86
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,399
No, you are not.

87
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,952
- Yes, yes, I am.
- God damn it.

88
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,456
- Who told you this?
- Master Sergeant with the clipboard.

89
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:20,990
- Bullshit!
- Right there. He's...

90
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:26,162
What's your name?

91
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:28,748
Norman.

92
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,381
How long you been in the Army?

93
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,092
Eight weeks.

94
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,263
That's home.

95
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:48,685
Do as you're told.
Don't get too close to anyone.

96
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,219
<i>On a hill far away</i>

97
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:02,040
<i>Stood an old rugged cross</i>

98
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:06,410
<i>The emblem of suffering and shame</i>

99
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,748
<i>I love the old cross</i>

100
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,260
<i>Where the dearest...</i>

101
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,179
<i>I will cling to the old rugged cross</i>

102
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,049
Hi. Hi. I'm Norman.

103
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:29,225
Which... Which way is the front?

104
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:32,020
"Which way is the front?"

105
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:37,859
All around us, kid, 'cause this is Germany.
We're surrounded by Krauts.

106
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,571
- Ain't that right, Grady?
- That's right.

107
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,331
Can I please have my book back?

108
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,876
- Where are the cigarettes?
- I don't smoke.

109
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:56,670
You're a bastard.

110
00:13:57,612 --> 00:14:00,173
- You go to tank school?
- Tank school? No.

111
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:05,061
I've never even seen the inside of a tank.
I'm a clerk typist.

112
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:10,233
Was heading to Fifth Corps HQ, they pulled
me off the truck. They sent me here.

113
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:14,229
- It's got to be a mistake.
- Mistake?

114
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:18,241
Army don't make mistakes.
It wouldn't do.

115
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,110
You from Missouri?

116
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:22,496
No.

117
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,290
- Are you from Chicago?
- You from Arkansas, ain't you?

118
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,791
- No, I'm from Pittsburgh...
- Hey, hush up, man.

119
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:28,993
Nobody gives a fuck where you from.

120
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:32,831
Are you a praying man?

121
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,375
I go to church.

122
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:39,429
Which denomination are you?
Episcopalian?

123
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:44,317
- Yeah, you are. You're a Mainliner, ain't you?
- Yeah. I am.

124
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,285
Are you saved?

125
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:48,530
I'm baptized.

126
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:50,941
- That ain't what I asked you.
- That ain't what he asked you.

127
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,734
- Gordo, what'd I ask him?
- See, you got to listen.

128
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,144
- Say it again.
- "Are you saved?"

129
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:59,315
Wait until you see it.

130
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,768
See what?

131
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,614
What a man can do to another man.

132
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:12,295
Before you find Jesus, why don't
you come take a look at your seat?

133
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:14,256
That's where you're gonna be.

134
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:18,084
Get a bucket of hot water from
the kitchen. Get that shit clean.

135
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:32,883
Oh, fuck.

136
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:35,787
Fuck.

137
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,383
Weren't supposed to be
no more Tigers, Don.

138
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:41,885
Tell my platoon that.

139
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:46,589
You send five tanks out. One comes back.
It's hard to believe we're winning the war.

140
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:58,101
Stop talking about yesterday's fight.
Think about today's.

141
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,708
- Straighten out!
- Hey! What's an SS doing here?

142
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:43,446
Hey, why are you bringing him
through here? Why isn't he sleeping?

143
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:45,523
G2 wants a prisoner to question.

144
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,717
I'll question him.
What's your favorite color?

145
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,037
Are you a good dancer?
Do you like fat girls?

146
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,956
- Get back!
- Beat his ass!

147
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:54,657
Stop! Stop it!

148
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,794
- Fucker!
- Fuck him up, Don!

149
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:01,881
- Motherfucker!
- Get the fuck... Get back!

150
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,334
- Go!
- Fucking tankers.

151
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:07,304
It's me, it's me. You got MPs everywhere.
You got to stop now.

152
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:09,697
- Just stop.
- I spilled my fucking coffee.

153
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,174
- Cocksuckers.
- Come on, Grady.

154
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,051
Fucking SS.

155
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,137
- You good, Top?
- Bring him through this camp...

156
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,775
You see that? He's an SS.

157
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,069
You kill every last one you can.
They're real assholes.

158
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,188
Fuck every last one. They started it.

159
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:26,740
- We finishing it.
- That's it.

160
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,701
- Done much killing?
- No.

161
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:30,869
You will.

162
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:32,996
- Boys, take him through that gun.
- Roger.

163
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:36,124
- What do I do with this?
- "What..." Shut up. Take a look at it.

164
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:37,334
- See that cover?
- Yeah.

165
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:38,535
Open it.

166
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:41,371
And now you killing. Close it up.

167
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,123
Now you ain't.

168
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:51,014
Main unit's punching east. We are
going north on a flank guard mission.

169
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:54,059
We'll tie up with Baker Company
from the 41st.

170
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:56,353
Sergeant Collier's with us now.

171
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:59,356
- He'll be acting platoon sergeant.
- Fine by me.

172
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,433
Good to have you, Don.

173
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:10,817
We're meeting Baker Company here.
Then, together we'll take this town.

174
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:14,538
After that, we're working
for Captain Waggoner.

175
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:17,574
- Any questions?
- I got one question.

176
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:21,419
- Peterson?
- I'm Binkowski, sir.

177
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:25,123
You start shaving your face?

178
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,655
First Platoon, mount up! Move out!

179
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,122
War's not going anywhere, sir.

180
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:47,520
You heard him. Mount up!

181
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:08,091
Hey!

182
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:09,759
Go fuck yourself, Wardaddy!

183
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:13,112
- Coffee's too hot.
- Still owe me 40 bucks!

184
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,689
What'd he say?

185
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,600
Mount up! Let's go, gents.

186
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,386
- Move front!
- Motherfucker.

187
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:24,307
- Okay, guns ready.
- Good luck, gentlemen!

188
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:46,755
All right, there might be a wolf
hiding in the sheep.

189
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:48,998
Kid, you're up. Cast an eyeball on them.

190
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,468
<i>Anything that makes a move,
you cut them right in half.</i>

191
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:54,946
People are in the way, that's their problem.
You do what you got to do, copy?

192
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:57,298
<i>- Copy.</i>
- You copy?

193
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:00,051
I copy.

194
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:03,847
- Gordo, talk him through that gun again.
- <i>Roger.</i>

195
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,141
Hey, gun's ready. Just pull the trigger.

196
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,652
Every five rounds is a tracer so
you can see what you're hitting.

197
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:14,774
And remember, short bursts.
That way you harvest more meat per bullet.

198
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:21,197
The Americans are over there

199
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:23,725
Keep moving

200
00:21:25,338 --> 00:21:26,885
The Americans are over there

201
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:29,472
Keep your hands up

202
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,537
Keep moving

203
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,155
She'll let you fuck her
for a chocolate bar.

204
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,533
- That's not true.
- It's not true?

205
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:08,328
- No.
- Okay. It's not true.

206
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:10,288
It's completely fucking true.

207
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,756
<i>Or just give her some smokes.</i>

208
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:13,842
You ain't got to fuck around
and give her a whole pack, neither.

209
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:15,677
- Norman, ignore him.
- Fucking four will do it.

210
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:19,172
Don't disappoint Christ, now.
Don't let them lead you astray.

211
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:21,558
You see, we can kill them,
but we can't fuck them,

212
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,134
<i>'cause it says so in the Bible.</i>

213
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:24,561
Stop, all right?

214
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:28,231
I'm done trying to convert you heathens.
You mind if I continue invading Germany?

215
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,567
Boyd, do you think Jesus loves Hitler?

216
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:34,721
Do I think Jesus loves Hitler?
I'd assume so.

217
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,741
If Hitler accepted Jesus into his heart
and got baptized, he'd be saved.

218
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:39,451
It ain't gonna save him
from man's justice.

219
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:41,244
What about your regular-issue
Nazi line trooper?

220
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:43,246
- No, I'm not gonna do this with you.
- Is he going to Heaven?

221
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:45,123
We've been talking about the
same dumb shit for three years.

222
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:47,083
You know how I stand on it.
You trying to rile me up now.

223
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:49,669
Hey, what about me, huh?
You think you could save me?

224
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,921
<i>Sing me a hymn?</i>

225
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:53,340
- Yeah, sure.
- Sing <i>Old Rugged Cross.</i>

226
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,424
I like the way your mouth
moves when you sing.

227
00:22:54,524 --> 00:22:55,550
- Don't.
- I like it.

228
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,886
- I'll sing it if you don't do that.
- Let me just touch your mustache.

229
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:59,554
- Don't touch me. Stop!
- I just wanna touch your mustache.

230
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:01,473
Why does that bother you so much
when I touch your mustache?

231
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:03,308
- I'll shoot you, I swear!
- All right, knock it off.

232
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:04,884
Knock off the horseplay.

233
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,641
Boyd, do you think Hitler'd fuck
one of us for a chocolate bar?

234
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:14,686
I hope so.

235
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:04,736
Ambush! Right!

236
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:06,154
Right side, ambush!

237
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,957
Fuck! Grady!

238
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:11,785
You watch that tree line!
We're ripe for an ambush!

239
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:13,953
Grady, cover right!

240
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:20,043
Father!

241
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:30,970
- What'd you see, Boyd?
- Just go out and blast them little fuckers!

242
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:34,140
- What'd you see?
- I didn't see nothing.

243
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:58,707
Norman!

244
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:02,010
You cocksucker.
Why didn't you take the shot?

245
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,588
He was just a kid. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, Sergeant.

246
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:08,675
You see what a kid can do?

247
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:13,680
Look! That's your fault.
That's your fucking fault.

248
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:16,441
Next German you see with a weapon,
you rake the dog shit out of him.

249
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,485
I don't care if it's a baby
with a butter knife in one hand

250
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:20,979
- and mama's titty in the other. You chop him up!
- Yes, Sergeant!

251
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,693
- Bible?
- Yeah?

252
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:39,789
All tanks, Wardaddy.

253
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:43,168
Looks like I'm it.

254
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,964
I'll lead the column.
Let's get us where we're going.

255
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:03,363
We have this thing set
up and on the way.

256
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:07,108
I sent over a couple men to keep contact,
and the officers have been briefed.

257
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:12,196
Stop right here, Gordo.

258
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:16,242
- Baker Company?
- Yes, sir!

259
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:19,395
- I'm not a sir.
- Me, neither.

260
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:20,914
- Where's your boss?
- Dead.

261
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,585
- Who's in charge of this column?
- I am.

262
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:29,381
Good. I'm talking to the right man.
Park it over there. Old Man's waiting.

263
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:49,201
Yes, thank you, sir,

264
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:51,495
don't tell me how long
my casualties can last.

265
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:55,332
Unless you want to come down here, stand
knee-deep in their guts and form an opinion.

266
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:58,668
Baker 6 out. Pencil-pushing motherfucker.
How you doing?

267
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:02,339
Load the casualties into a truck. We're gonna
drive them back to base ourselves.

268
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,665
Take care of our own. Come with me.

269
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:06,584
Hey, wake up!

270
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:10,338
- All right, how many tanks we got?
- Four.

271
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:12,949
Four? You're shitting me.

272
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:15,844
I asked for 10.

273
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,730
Miles! Sergeant Miles!

274
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,057
- Yes, sir?
- Get First Platoon ready.

275
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:22,859
You're working for him now.

276
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,486
If they can stand, they're in play.

277
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:26,863
- Roger.
- All right, here's the deal.

278
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:29,366
I got a platoon trapped in this
beet field by machine guns.

279
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:32,577
I sent my tracks in.
Jerry took them out.

280
00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:36,406
So, anti-tank guns there, there,
possibly there, I don't know.

281
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,751
I need you to rescue my guys.
Take the guns out.

282
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:41,494
I can do that.

283
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:44,548
All right, that clears this road
into town, you push forward.

284
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:46,207
I'll join you there. We'll clear it up.

285
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,668
Maybe they'll surrender.
Or maybe they'll fight.

286
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:54,716
- This high ground, you got any eyes on it?
- I had eyes there, gone. There, gone.

287
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:57,669
We're flying blind. It's you and me.

288
00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:00,397
Krauts got sights on this road.
I don't want to show my flank.

289
00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:01,898
Any objection if I come in here?

290
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:04,776
You can arrive on a fucking
magic carpet, for all I care.

291
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:08,063
I know who you are. I know
you know what you're doing.

292
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:11,158
You just paste them hard for me.

293
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:14,319
They murdered some good
boys out there today.

294
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,657
Why don't they just quit?

295
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:24,287
Would you?

296
00:28:24,562 --> 00:28:27,174
We got a platoon pinned down
in this field by MGs.

297
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:31,261
Krauts got anti-tank covering the field.
And once we cross this hedgerow,

298
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:34,181
we will be in range and in their
line of sight, so be alert.

299
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:37,258
- Hit anything that fucking moves.
- Yeah, unless they pound us first.

300
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,635
If they do, we'll know
exactly where they are.

301
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:42,472
Let's get these boys out of there
and smash those guns.

302
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:46,526
Then we'll capture the town,
stop for the night. Clear?

303
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:49,279
Why are we rescuing kittens
instead of just driving down into Berlin?

304
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,614
- Why are you such an asshole?
- That's a great question.

305
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:56,761
March order. Fury,
Old Phyllis, Lucy Sue, Murder Inc.

306
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:57,987
Let's go.

307
00:28:58,555 --> 00:28:59,915
All right, fuck sticks.

308
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:02,083
- Mount up! By squad!
- All right, mount up!

309
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:03,627
<i>All tanks, comm check.</i>

310
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:06,421
<i>- 1-4's up.</i>
<i>- Love 1-3 copies.</i>

311
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:08,623
- That's right, man.
- Need you to hold tight!

312
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:23,555
All tanks, Wardaddy. When we
hit open ground, line up on me.

313
00:29:23,747 --> 00:29:25,315
<i>Keep your spacing, don't bunch up.</i>

314
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:28,610
<i>On my signal, we'll drop
the doughs and roll up that 75.</i>

315
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,987
<i>- Everyone copy?</i>
- Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.

316
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,364
- Copy.<i>
- Love 1-3 copies.</i>

317
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:36,409
<i>Gordo, halt.</i>

318
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:39,112
<i>All tanks halt. All tanks halt.</i>

319
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:49,506
All right, let's get the boys off.
Get them off. Give me last man.

320
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:50,799
- All right, ladies, you heard the man.<i>
- Button up.</i>

321
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:53,677
Everybody off! Move out!
Move! Everybody off!

322
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:55,545
Close your hatch.

323
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,354
<i>All tanks, move out.
Hard right. Hard right.</i>

324
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:06,514
<i>- Move them out.
- Hard right. Hard right.</i>

325
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:07,983
<i>Fury's going. Let's go.</i>

326
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,726
<i>Move, move, move, move, move.</i>

327
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:13,238
Let's move now.
A hard stick right.

328
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:15,824
Everybody hold yourself. Jiggs, hold on.

329
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:17,409
Form in. Form in.

330
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:19,661
<i>- Catch up with the Fury.
- Stick right.</i>

331
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:20,745
<i>Now, catch up.</i>

332
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:23,373
- On my line, guys, on my line.<i>
- More gas. More gas.</i>

333
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:24,916
Mix it up.

334
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:26,293
- Keep them low!<i>
- Hold your line.</i>

335
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,161
<i>We're already drifting.</i>

336
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:30,505
Binkowski, keep an eyeball
on that high ground. Right.

337
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:32,465
<i>Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.</i>

338
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:35,585
<i>Watch that tree line right there.
Hold that, hold that.</i>

339
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:43,852
<i>- Ride on, ride on.</i>
- Hold tight.

340
00:30:43,952 --> 00:30:45,345
We're gonna bust through this shit.

341
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:48,106
- All right, here we go, men.
<i>- Left stick, left stick. What the fuck?</i>

342
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:49,858
<i>- It looks perfect, Tim.</i>
- Good?

343
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:50,984
Straight on, straight on.

344
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:53,445
<i>Doughs on the ground, doughs
on the ground. Keep an eye out.</i>

345
00:30:53,545 --> 00:30:55,071
- Straight, straight.
- Over here!

346
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:57,616
<i>Gordo, slow, slow, slow.</i>

347
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,159
We got bodies.

348
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,286
- Stick left of me.<i>
- Eyes on the floor.</i>

349
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:03,747
- Get up.
- Fall in! Fall in!

350
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:05,281
Straighten it out.

351
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:08,118
<i>- Watch your fucking spacing.
- You gotta left stick now.</i>

352
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:11,254
All right, let's hold up.
If I say hold back, hold back. Hold back.

353
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,089
- Left stick. Left stick. What the fuck?
- Come on!

354
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:14,674
Company, clear on the right.

355
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:16,918
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Clear it up and book it.

356
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:19,713
Speed up just a little bit.

357
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,308
Love 1-3, right stick! Right stick!
You got troops on the ground.

358
00:31:23,408 --> 00:31:25,802
<i>Fuck, right stick!
Right stick, God damn it!</i>

359
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:29,431
- Get your head out of your ass!
- They weren't fucking paying attention.

360
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,809
Get in tight. Go!

361
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:38,523
Down! Stay down! Down!

362
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:42,652
What the fuck is that?

363
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:46,448
Bible, hit that machine gun.

364
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:48,616
Traverse left, 800!

365
00:31:49,225 --> 00:31:51,419
- Steady!
- On. Fire!

366
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,704
On the way!

367
00:31:53,521 --> 00:31:54,873
<i>Good! Hit them! Hit them!</i>

368
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:00,345
Look forward! Look at your periscope!

369
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:02,714
- Bible, traverse back. On.
- Periscope!

370
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,057
- Clear!
- Fire!

371
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:05,508
On the way!

372
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,679
<i>Cease fire. Target destroyed.</i>

373
00:32:10,914 --> 00:32:12,057
<i>Roger, Ester, Wilco.</i>

374
00:32:12,457 --> 00:32:13,600
Fire!

375
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:17,187
Fuck! Anti-tank! H.E.! Traverse left.

376
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:21,374
<i>- Let's go. Traverse left.</i>
- Traverse left!

377
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:29,416
Just a ricochet. We're okay.

378
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:31,868
Bullshit! That's a Kraut high-velocity gun.
I can hear it whistling.

379
00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:36,331
<i>- Anti-tank! Left front, left front!</i>
- Got it! Down 15.

380
00:32:36,648 --> 00:32:37,874
- Clear!<i>
- Ready!</i>

381
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,584
- Fire!
- On the way!

382
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:44,714
600.

383
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:47,050
Fire!

384
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:48,635
- Clear!
- On the way!

385
00:32:51,454 --> 00:32:53,264
Okay, cease fire, cease fire.
Target destroyed.

386
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:54,849
Fire!

387
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:57,852
There's another gun!
Who's got eyes on it?

388
00:32:58,295 --> 00:32:59,696
Does anyone see it?

389
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:03,066
- Eyes up, everybody.
- Fire!

390
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:05,485
I don't see shit.

391
00:33:05,844 --> 00:33:08,288
- Where the fuck are you at?
<i>- Anti-tank, H.E.</i>

392
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:12,709
- Got it! Anti-tank, H.E. Traverse right!
- Anti-tank. Left front, left front. 600.

393
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:15,328
<i>- Right stick, right stick.</i>
- On! Fire!

394
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:16,955
On the way!

395
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:19,124
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em.

396
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,087
Fire!

397
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:33,063
All tanks, start squirting that tree line.
Let's light them up. Let's go.

398
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:35,432
- Let's clean it up.
<i>- Everybody squirt the fucking tree line.</i>

399
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:43,573
Hey! Hey! Start shooting!

400
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:46,651
- Well, what do I shoot at?
- The Nazis, dumb fuck!

401
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:56,369
That's it. Keep their
fucking heads down.

402
00:33:58,438 --> 00:33:59,664
You got to reload!

403
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:05,095
- Panzerfaust!
- Hey! Get him!

404
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:06,838
- I'm loading the gun. I'm loading the gun.
- Hit him!

405
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:08,631
Got him.

406
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,273
- Do your job! Do what you're here for!
- I was loading the gun!

407
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:18,841
<i>Machine gun, twelve o'clock!
Gordo, run those bastards over!</i>

408
00:34:23,004 --> 00:34:25,022
All tanks, hold here, hold here.

409
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,889
Get your boys in the fight!

410
00:34:33,515 --> 00:34:36,300
Fall out! Marching fire!

411
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,698
Come on!

412
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,553
Hey, squirt those Krauts on the left.
Do you see them?

413
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:49,055
<i>Will Actual, come in. This is Vicious.</i>

414
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:51,800
<i>- Krauts in the woods to your...</i>
- All I see are dead bodies.

415
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:53,602
How do you know they're dead?
Are you a doctor?

416
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:54,644
- Hit them!
- But they're dead!

417
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,179
Why would I shoot them
if they're already dead?

418
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,356
So they don't stand up
and shoot us in the ass!

419
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:00,066
- Fuck!
- Get them!

420
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,267
Fuck!

421
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:04,571
I can't fucking be
here any-fucking-more!

422
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:07,824
Turn your goddamn intercom off
if you're gonna bawl like that.

423
00:35:07,924 --> 00:35:09,317
I got it, Top.

424
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:15,573
I fucking give up. I fucking give up.
I can't be here anymore.

425
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:19,277
This ain't pretty, you know.
This is what we do.

426
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,622
- Boys, fight on foot.
- You take it.

427
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,171
I'm okay.

428
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,841
You're all right.

429
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,686
Close your eyes, son. Close your
eyes, son. Do you believe in Jesus?

430
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,330
You're all right, then.
You're all right, then.

431
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:23,699
I'm gonna pray with you now.

432
00:36:25,168 --> 00:36:29,397
Our father, Lord in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

433
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:33,702
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

434
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:36,538
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

435
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:39,499
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

436
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,043
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

437
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:47,123
For the kingdom, the power and the glory,
forever and ever, dear Lord. Amen.

438
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,552
I had the best bow gunner
in the entire Ninth Army in that seat.

439
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,414
And now I got you.

440
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:08,836
I promised my crew a long time ago
I'd keep them alive.

441
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,025
- You're getting in the way of that.
- I'm sorry.

442
00:37:14,217 --> 00:37:18,621
Okay, I am trained to
type 60 words a minute.

443
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:24,060
I am not trained to machine-gun dead bodies.
I am trying my very best.

444
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:28,498
Where'd you get that U.S. Army coat?
Where'd you get it?

445
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,378
Who'd you kill, boy?
Where did you get that coat, boy?

446
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,171
Forgive me. Let me go, please

447
00:37:36,072 --> 00:37:39,175
Who did you kill? What'd you do?

448
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,076
Don't shoot!

449
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,103
Let me go, please, let me go

450
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:43,688
- Who'd you kill, boy?
- Sergeant!

451
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:45,816
- Back it up, boys!
- Hold on. Hold on!

452
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:48,068
- Back it up, boys.
- Back it up, boys.

453
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:51,146
Norman! Get out here!

454
00:37:57,594 --> 00:37:59,554
Norman, come here.

455
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:03,191
Come on, son.

456
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:17,848
- I can't hear you.
- Wait.

457
00:38:17,948 --> 00:38:20,008
Sergeant. Call your dogs off.

458
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:23,802
I have a family

459
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,887
This is my wife, my children

460
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:27,556
Shut your mouth

461
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:32,561
Kneel

462
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:44,574
You are no goddamn good to me
unless you can kill Krauts.

463
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:48,078
Put a big fat hole in his back.

464
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:52,499
Put a big fat hole in his fucking back.

465
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,169
No.

466
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:57,953
Why the hell not?

467
00:38:59,114 --> 00:39:00,256
It's not right.

468
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:06,396
"Not right"? We're not here for right
and wrong. We're here to kill them.

469
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:09,516
Why are you here?
You're here to kill him.

470
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,976
You know why he's here?

471
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:14,738
He's here to kill you.

472
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:17,708
He's here to kill you, Norman. He's here
to rip your throat out with a bullet.

473
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:19,317
Go to hell.

474
00:39:27,392 --> 00:39:29,285
I'm trying to teach you something.

475
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,088
You here to get me killed?

476
00:39:32,188 --> 00:39:33,465
- No.
- You gonna get me killed?

477
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:36,092
- No.
- I need you to perform.

478
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,931
Just get it over with.
Just get it over with.

479
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:43,767
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. I know you can.

480
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:47,512
He kills you, or you kill him.
Simple math.

481
00:39:47,787 --> 00:39:49,222
You or him. Pick.

482
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:51,441
- Just kill me.
- Come here.

483
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:56,312
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me! Please!

484
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,314
I can't do it!

485
00:40:04,804 --> 00:40:06,322
Fucking stop!

486
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:09,100
Please stop.

487
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:12,620
Oh, no, no. This is the easy part.

488
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:14,330
What the hell?

489
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:17,801
- All right.
- Fuck. Please don't make me do this.

490
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:19,252
Don't make me do this.

491
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:23,965
It's all right. One, two...

492
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:29,846
Do it, Norman. Do it, Norman.

493
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:33,266
Do it, Norman.

494
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,526
Do your job.

495
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:45,362
Waddell, where you at?

496
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:54,871
- Waddell!
- Move it!

497
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,956
Move it!

498
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:11,596
Come on, Norman.

499
00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:14,057
Let's go.

500
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:32,934
Is this supposed to
make a man out of me?

501
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:36,588
Is this supposed to make a man out of me?
'Cause my conscience is...

502
00:41:36,688 --> 00:41:40,066
- Sit down.
- It's clean. My conscience is clean.

503
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:42,293
I'm keeping it that way.

504
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,779
Look right here. Hot coffee.

505
00:41:45,655 --> 00:41:46,965
Norman?

506
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,766
Don might be crazier than a
shithouse rat, but he's solid.

507
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:10,488
We've been together since before Africa.

508
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:13,199
I won't fight with anybody else.

509
00:42:13,516 --> 00:42:15,035
Me, neither.

510
00:42:15,518 --> 00:42:18,830
There ain't no crew stayed
together like we have, Norman.

511
00:42:19,564 --> 00:42:21,291
That's 'cause of him.

512
00:42:25,695 --> 00:42:29,632
First time we got shot at,
down in North Africa,

513
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:33,470
Don, he done shit his drawers full.

514
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:36,606
He stunk the tank up real loud.

515
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:38,266
It's true.

516
00:42:43,672 --> 00:42:45,740
We move out in 15.

517
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:50,903
Norman.

518
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:55,692
I haven't seen you eat anything all day.
Make sure you get something to eat.

519
00:43:00,897 --> 00:43:03,399
You best go eat something.

520
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:07,278
Make sure he sees it, too.

521
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:45,733
There you go, boys. Keep pounding them.

522
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,339
They got signs around their necks.
What do them signs say?

523
00:44:32,822 --> 00:44:36,768
"I'm a coward and refused
to fight for the German people."

524
00:44:36,868 --> 00:44:38,436
The SS does that.

525
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:42,640
Let them rip themselves
to pieces, huh? Fuck them.

526
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:53,660
<i>Baker 6. Love 1-6. I got eyes on the town.
We're ready to commence assault.</i>

527
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,246
<i>Baker 6 copies. Initiate your attack.</i>

528
00:44:56,346 --> 00:44:59,616
<i>Me and my boys will hit them
from the south. Over and out.</i>

529
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:02,419
<i>We'll split up here.
1-4, 1-3, you take left.</i>

530
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:05,088
<i>Binkowski, you follow me,
and stay off my ass.</i>

531
00:45:05,188 --> 00:45:06,256
Check the hotel.

532
00:45:06,356 --> 00:45:08,124
- Come back.<i>
- Copy. I got you, Daddy.</i>

533
00:45:16,658 --> 00:45:17,759
Clear the alley!

534
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:23,039
Keep moving, Tex.

535
00:45:23,582 --> 00:45:24,683
<i>Go.</i>

536
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,110
<i>Gordo, just punch through
that wall of smoke.</i>

537
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,278
<i>Copy.</i>

538
00:45:28,378 --> 00:45:31,798
Okay, hard left.
Nine o'clock, nine o'clock.

539
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:00,585
Move up.

540
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:06,332
<i>- Gordo, halt, halt.</i>
- All right, hold here.

541
00:46:09,402 --> 00:46:10,594
Grandpa

542
00:46:10,694 --> 00:46:12,439
Where are the German soldiers?

543
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:15,200
Sniper!

544
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,326
Cover!

545
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:17,861
Get down!

546
00:46:18,094 --> 00:46:19,495
Bible, follow my burst.

547
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:25,660
On the way!

548
00:46:39,783 --> 00:46:41,259
Keep firing on that window!

549
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,473
Come on! Move up!

550
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,067
Go!

551
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,518
Keep moving.

552
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,983
Keep moving.

553
00:46:57,717 --> 00:47:00,970
Come on, keep moving up.
Watch that doorway. Watch that doorway.

554
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:07,410
<i>Halt, halt, Gordo, halt.</i>

555
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:11,882
Binkowski, see that Kraut stinger in the
cellar on my left? Mind giving him what for?

556
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:14,084
I'm gonna slap him around
a little bit for you.

557
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:15,585
<i>Button up.</i>

558
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:20,256
Hit him!

559
00:47:22,701 --> 00:47:23,968
Fuck you, Jerry!

560
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,763
God damn.

561
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,841
All right, Gordo, forward.

562
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:41,611
Fucking eyes up, everywhere we go.

563
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:46,041
<i>Gordo, hard right,
three o'clock into the square.</i>

564
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:48,376
<i>Binkowski, you take the far end.
You cover our tail.</i>

565
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:49,703
<i>Gotcha.</i>

566
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:06,928
Anti-tank. Traverse left.

567
00:48:07,537 --> 00:48:09,431
<i>Throw some Willy Pete
in that ground floor.</i>

568
00:48:10,415 --> 00:48:11,558
Clear, Boyd.

569
00:48:12,876 --> 00:48:14,019
<i>Fire when ready.</i>

570
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,407
No, they cooking. Go, go.

571
00:48:42,447 --> 00:48:44,382
Good shooting, kid.
Keep stacking them up.

572
00:48:44,783 --> 00:48:46,718
You should've let them burn.

573
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:55,894
All right, look inside.

574
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:58,855
Check the doorways, y'all.

575
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:01,941
<i>Gordo, halt here.</i>

576
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:05,736
Please stop shooting!

577
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:07,529
Come here

578
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:10,074
The soldiers want to surrender

579
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:12,826
We give up

580
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,661
The war is over

581
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:16,622
Thank God

582
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:18,685
Tell them to come out

583
00:49:18,785 --> 00:49:21,210
with their hands up

584
00:49:22,153 --> 00:49:24,256
Binkowski, load an H.E. and get
ready to put it in that bank

585
00:49:24,356 --> 00:49:27,467
- if these people want to test us.
- It's my pleasure.

586
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:30,220
Check the door, check the door.

587
00:49:32,497 --> 00:49:34,674
Fuck, it's a bunch of kids.

588
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,894
Cut him down! Separate them.

589
00:49:38,878 --> 00:49:39,905
Come on.

590
00:49:40,005 --> 00:49:42,524
<i>Here they come. Keep an eye out.</i>

591
00:49:42,966 --> 00:49:45,118
- Right over there!
- Let's go!

592
00:49:45,218 --> 00:49:47,237
- Go. Go.
- Fuck.

593
00:49:52,726 --> 00:49:54,911
Why you looking so sour, Kraut?
What you got?

594
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,671
You. You.

595
00:49:56,771 --> 00:49:57,914
Burgermeister.

596
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:00,305
Is he the one hanging kids?

597
00:50:02,277 --> 00:50:04,387
Hey. Shoot that guy.

598
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:05,722
- This guy?
- Yeah, him.

599
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:08,258
The SS cocksucker with the busted wing.

600
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:13,430
Hey, Angel. This one's yours.

601
00:50:14,205 --> 00:50:16,599
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> asshole.

602
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:18,977
Motherfucker.

603
00:50:39,522 --> 00:50:42,046
Hey, you! You're real pretty.

604
00:50:42,234 --> 00:50:44,169
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

605
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:47,305
- I'm gonna take care of you, okay?
- Okay.

606
00:50:47,405 --> 00:50:50,475
- You want to see the tank?
- Hey, I'm gonna marry this girl.

607
00:50:50,575 --> 00:50:52,769
It's gonna be for two.
Gonna be him, then me.

608
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:54,354
All right, you go on up there.

609
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:56,330
- That's it. Yeah.
- Give me your hand.

610
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,224
You boys all come through okay?

611
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:00,443
- Just a walk in the park.
- All right, Sergeant.

612
00:51:00,543 --> 00:51:03,280
You get some rest and relax.
We'll go win the war in the morning.

613
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,481
Yes, sir.

614
00:51:19,562 --> 00:51:20,955
Norman.

615
00:51:24,276 --> 00:51:26,778
It wasn't nothing, right?

616
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:28,880
Come again, Sergeant?

617
00:51:29,406 --> 00:51:32,809
Rubbing out those Heinies.
You splashed them real good.

618
00:51:32,909 --> 00:51:34,844
Wasn't nothing, right?

619
00:51:36,746 --> 00:51:38,748
Sure, Sergeant.

620
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:41,476
Yeah, it wasn't nothing.

621
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:44,921
Fact, I kind of liked it.

622
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:50,694
I want to show you something.

623
00:52:17,287 --> 00:52:19,389
They knew we were coming.

624
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:26,187
So they got drunk as lords
and they shot themselves at sunup.

625
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:30,425
Why are you showing me this?

626
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:38,741
Ideals are peaceful.
History is violent.

627
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:04,601
Do what I tell you.

628
00:53:05,877 --> 00:53:09,064
You do that,
you'll make it through this thing.

629
00:53:17,847 --> 00:53:18,948
Come on.

630
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:53,108
Who is inside?

631
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,192
Just me

632
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:57,995
Bullshit

633
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:13,086
Watch her.

634
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,855
Come out!

635
00:54:33,773 --> 00:54:35,024
Right now!

636
00:54:35,508 --> 00:54:37,027
Hey! Hey!

637
00:54:37,886 --> 00:54:41,156
Come on. Calm down.
Stand fucking here.

638
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:45,084
Close the door and lock it.
Lock the fucking door.

639
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:50,373
You said no one was here

640
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,541
You could have gotten her killed

641
00:54:53,778 --> 00:54:55,586
She's my cousin

642
00:54:56,288 --> 00:54:58,756
I'm sorry. Please

643
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:01,842
- I was scared
- Sit down

644
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:34,625
Bring me hot water

645
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:40,038
Go

646
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:55,605
Put the gun down.

647
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:59,300
Grab a seat. You make me nervous.

648
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,112
Come here

649
00:56:37,723 --> 00:56:40,083
What's your name, young lady?

650
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:47,115
Emma.

651
00:57:33,186 --> 00:57:34,579
Hey.

652
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:02,816
Fuck! Grenade!

653
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:11,408
Get away from that window
before they shoot the hell out of you.

654
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:18,689
Yeah! How was it, Gor?

655
00:58:19,524 --> 00:58:21,001
It was good.

656
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,178
You get your ass up there, Boyd.

657
00:58:23,278 --> 00:58:25,463
- I hope you get scabies.
- Shit.

658
01:00:03,211 --> 01:00:04,688
She's a good, clean girl.

659
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:09,651
If you don't take her in
that bedroom, I will.

660
01:00:24,182 --> 01:00:25,641
No

661
01:00:27,494 --> 01:00:29,878
They're young

662
01:00:31,056 --> 01:00:33,691
and they're alive

663
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:27,729
Can I see your hand?
Can I see your hand?

664
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:31,566
I'm not gonna bite you. This hand.

665
01:01:32,175 --> 01:01:33,443
Yeah.

666
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:39,265
Now, you can tell a lot about a person
from the lines on their hand.

667
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:45,254
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

668
01:01:46,606 --> 01:01:48,500
All right, this, you see that?

669
01:01:49,943 --> 01:01:52,370
That's the Ring of Solomon.

670
01:01:52,529 --> 01:01:55,599
It means you help people,
you understand them.

671
01:01:55,699 --> 01:01:57,467
It's really rare.

672
01:01:58,493 --> 01:02:01,638
Really rare. You see?
You see that, though?

673
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:03,473
Yeah, I got it, too.

674
01:02:06,543 --> 01:02:09,145
My grandma taught me how to do this.

675
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:14,401
You see this right here?
That is your heart line.

676
01:02:17,053 --> 01:02:19,213
From the looks of this,

677
01:02:19,556 --> 01:02:24,202
you are going to have one
great love in your life.

678
01:03:47,352 --> 01:03:49,662
You don't have to say a word.

679
01:04:17,507 --> 01:04:19,025
Sit down.

680
01:04:20,802 --> 01:04:21,945
Thank you.

681
01:04:24,389 --> 01:04:25,615
What's that?

682
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:29,586
It's hot.

683
01:04:29,686 --> 01:04:31,871
- "It's hot"?
- Yeah, you just...

684
01:04:32,897 --> 01:04:35,300
Normie! Nor?

685
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,711
Norman, where could you be?

686
01:04:39,529 --> 01:04:40,630
Oh, shit.

687
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,182
<i>Pinche,</i> Norman!

688
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:44,059
- Norman?<i>
- Pinche,</i> Norman.

689
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,219
Time for you to act the man!

690
01:04:46,494 --> 01:04:49,439
We got you fixed up good.
Now, look, there a special gal.

691
01:04:49,539 --> 01:04:51,316
She's down there and
she's waiting on you.

692
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:54,194
And all you got to do is come on down.
She wide open just jump on in.

693
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:57,272
Yeah, she looks a little
bit like a whore, but...

694
01:05:02,052 --> 01:05:05,864
- What?
- I think maybe we too late, Gor.

695
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:09,284
Norman. What did you do?

696
01:05:10,435 --> 01:05:15,440
Norman, you sneaky snail.
What did you do?

697
01:05:15,982 --> 01:05:18,084
Wait a second, did you...

698
01:05:18,526 --> 01:05:20,003
Did you...

699
01:05:20,737 --> 01:05:24,174
Did you take this pretty
young thing for a roll?

700
01:05:24,532 --> 01:05:25,809
Yeah, you're real pretty.

701
01:05:25,909 --> 01:05:28,145
- Did you do that?
- What's with your lip?

702
01:05:28,245 --> 01:05:31,565
What's with your lip? Why it quiver?
Don't worry about me, I'm a friend.

703
01:05:31,665 --> 01:05:33,525
He fuck you, you fuck me.
That how it works.

704
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,736
You got to pass the plate.
Come on, make a donation to the cause.

705
01:05:36,836 --> 01:05:38,655
- All right, don't touch her.
- Don't touch her?

706
01:05:38,755 --> 01:05:40,490
- Don't touch her.
- Don't ever fucking tell me what to do.

707
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:43,160
You think you get some pussy and
now you can fucking act like a man?

708
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,196
Anyone touches the girl,
they get their teeth kicked in.

709
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,118
That's how it gonna be?

710
01:05:55,939 --> 01:05:57,207
Well, all right, then.

711
01:05:59,818 --> 01:06:01,419
I guess it's Norman Day, huh?

712
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,601
Shit, Top.

713
01:06:09,286 --> 01:06:11,762
It's your day, Norman.

714
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:17,602
You should drink that.

715
01:06:18,086 --> 01:06:21,606
- You best take a bite.
- You a man, right? Drink it.

716
01:06:24,175 --> 01:06:25,827
- Attaboy.
- You did the nasty.

717
01:06:25,927 --> 01:06:27,287
Drink it, there it is.

718
01:06:27,387 --> 01:06:28,872
Your day.

719
01:06:28,972 --> 01:06:30,207
There it is.

720
01:06:30,307 --> 01:06:32,000
- You like that?
- Don't fucking touch me.

721
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,543
Don't touch you? You a man, right?

722
01:06:33,643 --> 01:06:36,413
- Get some pussy, you a man, right?
- Get your fucking hands off me.

723
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:38,590
Fucking piece of shit.

724
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,051
Watch this. How about that?
How about I just kill you, huh?

725
01:06:41,151 --> 01:06:42,761
How about I fucking kill you right here?

726
01:06:42,861 --> 01:06:45,755
- Grady? Grady?
- Fuck. Don't you fucking speak...

727
01:06:46,197 --> 01:06:47,307
Oh, God!

728
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:50,427
- What the fuck is that? Gasoline?
- Taste like gasoline? Hey.

729
01:06:50,785 --> 01:06:53,430
Fucking north Georgia right there, boy.

730
01:06:53,538 --> 01:06:55,056
Fuckup.

731
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,059
Donkey.

732
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:02,605
Appreciate it.

733
01:07:03,965 --> 01:07:05,525
Look at that.

734
01:07:16,353 --> 01:07:18,163
Go have a seat.

735
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:26,129
My beverage.

736
01:07:31,826 --> 01:07:33,353
That's the girl's egg.

737
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:34,980
That's Gordo's egg.

738
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,058
- That's the girl's egg.
- Then where the fuck was my egg?

739
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:45,231
You want to say grace?

740
01:07:45,882 --> 01:07:47,275
This meal's for you.

741
01:07:47,717 --> 01:07:49,119
Roger.

742
01:07:49,219 --> 01:07:51,538
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

743
01:07:51,638 --> 01:07:52,739
Our father,

744
01:07:53,056 --> 01:07:56,534
thank you for preserving our lives another
day on Earth so we may execute your will.

745
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:00,330
We love you, dear Lord. Thank you for this
meal and this wonderful company. Amen.

746
01:08:00,689 --> 01:08:02,165
Amen.

747
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:09,798
Emma.

748
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:15,845
Offer the girl her plate.

749
01:08:19,165 --> 01:08:20,684
There you go. Oops!

750
01:08:21,418 --> 01:08:22,727
Hold on.

751
01:08:29,968 --> 01:08:32,404
Hang on, there.
I'm gonna fix that for you.

752
01:08:32,971 --> 01:08:35,782
Let me just fix this for you real quick.

753
01:08:38,351 --> 01:08:40,203
I didn't touch her.

754
01:08:45,817 --> 01:08:47,702
Switch with me.

755
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:05,228
Y'all were gonna eat like
kings and queens over here.

756
01:09:06,379 --> 01:09:08,398
And we weren't invited.

757
01:09:08,757 --> 01:09:11,535
I wonder why we weren't invited.

758
01:09:11,635 --> 01:09:13,862
Guess they too good for us.

759
01:09:20,727 --> 01:09:21,878
I'm enjoying my meal, boys.

760
01:09:21,978 --> 01:09:23,338
- Are you?
- Enjoying your meal?

761
01:09:23,438 --> 01:09:28,201
And as much as you want to destroy it,
you're not gonna fucking stop me.

762
01:09:28,318 --> 01:09:30,053
- And neither will you.
- No, sir.

763
01:09:30,153 --> 01:09:32,047
And neither will you.

764
01:09:39,496 --> 01:09:41,256
Hey, Norman.

765
01:09:42,165 --> 01:09:44,100
Do you like horses?

766
01:09:48,213 --> 01:09:49,939
Don likes horses.

767
01:09:51,174 --> 01:09:53,151
Ain't that right, Don?

768
01:09:58,348 --> 01:09:59,908
We're eating.

769
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:02,827
No, we're not. I'm done.

770
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:04,704
I'm fucking done eating.

771
01:10:14,781 --> 01:10:17,483
Hey, in France,

772
01:10:18,368 --> 01:10:21,270
we hit the beach right after D-Day.

773
01:10:22,205 --> 01:10:23,515
Right?

774
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:28,394
And we had to fight through
all these fucking hedgerows.

775
01:10:28,795 --> 01:10:33,765
Fucking pain in the ass, right?
We finally hit open country,

776
01:10:33,865 --> 01:10:37,153
and we linked up with the British and the
Canadians and you know what we did?

777
01:10:37,554 --> 01:10:39,406
You know what we did.

778
01:10:39,931 --> 01:10:44,744
We trapped an entire Kraut army
pulling back into Germany.

779
01:10:48,356 --> 01:10:49,833
We fucked them up.

780
01:10:50,317 --> 01:10:53,303
- Yeah.
- Yes, we did.

781
01:10:53,403 --> 01:10:59,759
There was dead Krauts and horses,
busted up tanks and cars for miles.

782
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,412
Miles.

783
01:11:04,164 --> 01:11:06,232
Your eyes see it,

784
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:09,978
but your head can't make no sense of it.

785
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:13,389
And we go in there...

786
01:11:17,594 --> 01:11:20,238
And for three whole days,

787
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:24,042
we shoot the wounded horses.
All day long.

788
01:11:24,142 --> 01:11:26,995
Sunup to sundown, just shooting horses.

789
01:11:27,604 --> 01:11:30,206
And they were some hot summer days.

790
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,461
I ain't never smelled
nothing like that, Top.

791
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:39,141
Do you know how you kill a horse?
You pet it on the...

792
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:41,268
Pet it on the forehead, no?

793
01:11:41,368 --> 01:11:43,937
And it becomes your friend,
it goes like this.

794
01:11:44,037 --> 01:11:47,682
And then you shoot it
right through the spine.

795
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:50,060
And the sound of it?

796
01:11:50,794 --> 01:11:55,398
Those fucking screaming horses?
Do you remember that, Don?

797
01:11:57,676 --> 01:12:01,287
All the black clouds of flies
just buzzing around.

798
01:12:01,763 --> 01:12:05,241
It was like being in a giant beehive.

799
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,660
But you weren't there.

800
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:22,217
That was a real fine story.
Pleasant mealtime talk. Thank you.

801
01:12:22,492 --> 01:12:24,978
Thank you. Thank you.

802
01:12:25,078 --> 01:12:27,222
It is what happened, Don.

803
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:32,277
What happened, happened.
What's gonna happen is gonna happen.

804
01:12:32,377 --> 01:12:34,488
Sitting here playing house
with a couple bitch Krauts

805
01:12:34,588 --> 01:12:37,273
- ain't gonna change a fucking thing.
- Shut the fuck up.

806
01:12:37,799 --> 01:12:40,402
- Why should I shut up?
- You shouldn't.

807
01:12:58,236 --> 01:13:00,255
I'm just drunk. I'm sorry.

808
01:13:15,045 --> 01:13:16,146
Where's Love 1-6?

809
01:13:16,546 --> 01:13:18,990
- Right here.
- The Old Man wants you.

810
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,942
- How come?
- You got a mission.

811
01:13:22,928 --> 01:13:24,320
Let's go.

812
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:29,324
Where are you going?

813
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:32,436
To take the next town

814
01:13:32,696 --> 01:13:34,830
and the next and the next

815
01:13:35,098 --> 01:13:37,666
until you people quit

816
01:13:38,068 --> 01:13:39,386
Do you have a pen? I'll write you.

817
01:13:39,486 --> 01:13:41,930
Y'all getting married?
Is that what the fuck y'all doing?

818
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,465
This a fucking wedding?

819
01:13:44,241 --> 01:13:46,551
Hurry up. There are more of them.

820
01:13:47,118 --> 01:13:49,137
What am I walking into?

821
01:13:50,205 --> 01:13:54,667
A recon plane spotted a troop
concentration moving west, here.

822
01:13:55,418 --> 01:13:57,729
Battalion needs you
to guard these crossroads here

823
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,231
in this grid on the overlay.

824
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:04,402
- How many troops did he see?
- I don't know.

825
01:14:04,928 --> 01:14:06,863
What kind of troops?

826
01:14:07,931 --> 01:14:10,241
They have tanks, horses, artillery?

827
01:14:11,226 --> 01:14:14,662
I wish I could help you.
He took fire, he got the fuck out of there.

828
01:14:15,146 --> 01:14:16,873
Enough to spook the Colonel.

829
01:14:17,899 --> 01:14:19,634
All the tanks are driving on Berlin.

830
01:14:19,734 --> 01:14:22,387
There's a couple of thousand cooks,
mechanics and doctors here.

831
01:14:22,487 --> 01:14:24,964
Those Krauts hit them,
it'll be a slaughter.

832
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:28,385
All we got is you.

833
01:14:30,328 --> 01:14:32,397
We need you to the crossroads
fast as you can.

834
01:14:32,497 --> 01:14:35,317
Secure them. Don't stop for anything.
You understand?

835
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:38,728
Take my gas if you have to.
If those troops get past you,

836
01:14:40,171 --> 01:14:42,523
they're gonna smash
into the supply train.

837
01:14:43,091 --> 01:14:45,101
Then the whole division's fucked.

838
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:48,238
All right, sir. We're on the way.

839
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:52,016
- Is that gas?
- Open it up.

840
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:54,211
- Yeah, it's good.
- Okay.

841
01:14:54,311 --> 01:14:56,663
- Incoming!
- Grady, jump, jump, jump!

842
01:15:15,582 --> 01:15:17,183
Grady, you up?

843
01:15:27,886 --> 01:15:29,779
You good?

844
01:15:30,138 --> 01:15:31,623
Boys, good?

845
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:32,916
Thank the Krauts for that.

846
01:15:33,016 --> 01:15:34,125
Binkowski?

847
01:15:34,225 --> 01:15:35,252
- Davis, good?
- Grady!

848
01:15:35,352 --> 01:15:36,619
Everybody up!

849
01:15:37,354 --> 01:15:38,705
You up?

850
01:15:40,398 --> 01:15:42,091
I'm up.

851
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:52,853
All right, let's get an
aid station right there.

852
01:15:52,953 --> 01:15:55,397
- Check Peterson. We're gonna mount up.
- Norman!

853
01:15:55,497 --> 01:15:57,098
- Emma!
- I got him.

854
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,934
Emma!

855
01:16:03,546 --> 01:16:05,782
- Fuck.
- Who do you think you are, huh?

856
01:16:05,882 --> 01:16:07,025
Jesus Christ?

857
01:16:08,468 --> 01:16:09,619
Fuck!

858
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:13,022
You gonna raise her up, Norman?
Get your ass back on the fucking tank.

859
01:16:13,122 --> 01:16:14,666
- Fuck is wrong with you?
- What the fuck are you doing?

860
01:16:14,766 --> 01:16:16,418
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What you gonna do?

861
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:19,546
- You gonna get mad? Feel anything?
- Piece of shit!

862
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:21,298
- That's it, come on! Come on.
- Fuck you!

863
01:16:21,398 --> 01:16:23,166
- You feel it?
- Fuck you!

864
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:26,552
It's called war! You feel it?

865
01:16:29,739 --> 01:16:32,676
Get your fucking spindly ass
back on that fucking tank!

866
01:16:32,951 --> 01:16:35,470
Where the fuck you think you are?

867
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:41,851
Oh, God, why?

868
01:16:44,004 --> 01:16:45,855
Tankers, mount up!

869
01:17:36,473 --> 01:17:38,233
You see that?

870
01:17:43,021 --> 01:17:45,582
That's an entire city on fire.

871
01:17:52,906 --> 01:17:55,519
I started this war
killing Germans in Africa,

872
01:17:55,619 --> 01:17:58,762
then France, then Belgium.
Now I'm killing Germans in Germany.

873
01:18:01,122 --> 01:18:02,940
It will end.

874
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,084
Soon.

875
01:18:06,336 --> 01:18:09,606
But before it does,
a lot more people got to die.

876
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:52,732
Fuck! Reverse hard left!
Hard left! Reverse!

877
01:18:54,092 --> 01:18:56,486
- Fuck!
- Back up, back up, back up! Hard left!

878
01:18:57,804 --> 01:18:59,748
<i>Hatches! Hatches! Back up!</i>

879
01:18:59,848 --> 01:19:01,708
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

880
01:19:01,808 --> 01:19:03,627
<i>Back up. Left stick.</i>

881
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:06,295
<i>Go, go, go! Hard stick!</i>

882
01:19:06,563 --> 01:19:08,498
What the fuck was it?

883
01:19:08,732 --> 01:19:11,668
That was an 88. It's a goddamn tank.

884
01:19:11,943 --> 01:19:13,169
Where the fuck is it?

885
01:19:15,897 --> 01:19:19,476
- Tank! 12 o'clock, 800 yards.
- I see it! It's a goddamn Tiger!

886
01:19:19,576 --> 01:19:22,829
<i>- Put some fucking smoke in his face!</i>
- Let's go, Grady. Smoke up, Grady.

887
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:24,389
- Clear!
- On the way!

888
01:19:26,883 --> 01:19:29,361
We have to get to the crossroads.
We got to get past them.

889
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:31,238
Don, let's get the fuck out
of here! Let's go!

890
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:33,990
Unless he drowns himself in a
shit-filled ditch, he's our problem.

891
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:35,325
Hit that son of a bitch!

892
01:19:35,425 --> 01:19:37,077
- Almost up!<i>
- Light the bastard!</i>

893
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:38,653
- Clear!
- On the way!

894
01:19:39,971 --> 01:19:41,248
Shoot that fucker!

895
01:19:41,348 --> 01:19:43,199
<i>Fire when ready!</i>

896
01:19:44,267 --> 01:19:46,244
Stop! Stop! Stop!

897
01:19:53,443 --> 01:19:54,835
Driver make ready

898
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:56,846
Load Anti-Tank

899
01:19:57,948 --> 01:19:59,349
All right, all tanks, move forward!

900
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:00,592
Fuck!

901
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:03,228
<i>- Peterson, right flank!</i>
- Right stick.

902
01:20:03,328 --> 01:20:05,272
Davis, left with me, stay abreast.

903
01:20:05,372 --> 01:20:07,057
Let's go right at them,
let's go right at them!

904
01:20:07,157 --> 01:20:09,860
Gordo, left flank.
Let's bum-rush this cocksucker!

905
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,228
<i>Right stick. Taking the right flank.</i>

906
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:16,684
New target

907
01:20:16,784 --> 01:20:18,192
Tank on the left

908
01:20:19,452 --> 01:20:21,803
10 o'clock... 700 meters

909
01:20:23,515 --> 01:20:24,958
He's coming out.

910
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:26,200
Fire!

911
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:28,837
<i>- Loader, A.P, A.P.</i>
- Clear!

912
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:30,538
- Hit 'em!
- On the way!

913
01:20:31,356 --> 01:20:32,382
<i>Commence!</i>

914
01:20:32,482 --> 01:20:34,751
- All right, pump him! Pump him!<i>
- Gyros on!</i>

915
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:39,431
- What do you want, Top?<i>
- Loader, A.P., A.P., smash him.</i>

916
01:20:39,531 --> 01:20:41,091
You're clear, Boyd!

917
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:45,387
A.P., 500 yards. Fire!

918
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:47,397
Elevate... 600 meters

919
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,649
- Again!
- Fuck, Grady, put it in, now.

920
01:20:49,749 --> 01:20:51,059
- Clear!
- On the way!

921
01:20:56,506 --> 01:20:57,649
God!

922
01:20:58,049 --> 01:20:59,359
God damn it!

923
01:20:59,634 --> 01:21:00,944
- Fuck!<i>
- Hit 'em!</i>

924
01:21:01,636 --> 01:21:03,571
- Clear!
- On the way!

925
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:07,075
Same target fire!

926
01:21:10,312 --> 01:21:11,713
They got Peterson!

927
01:21:11,813 --> 01:21:13,539
<i>God damn!</i>

928
01:21:22,365 --> 01:21:24,226
- It's a fucking beast.
- Fuck!

929
01:21:24,326 --> 01:21:25,927
Gordo, flank left! Left!

930
01:21:26,903 --> 01:21:29,773
Davis, cross him.
Flank right! Flank right!

931
01:21:29,873 --> 01:21:31,725
Copy! Right stick! Right stick!

932
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:34,144
<i>Traverse left.</i>

933
01:21:34,377 --> 01:21:37,313
- Davis, he's lining up!
- Fire!

934
01:21:38,965 --> 01:21:40,882
Target 11 o'clock

935
01:21:41,134 --> 01:21:43,653
Shoot the son of a bitch!
He's lining up on Roy!

936
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,289
<i>God damn it, I said fire!</i>

937
01:21:46,389 --> 01:21:47,657
Fire!

938
01:21:53,855 --> 01:21:56,324
- God damn it.
- Fuck!

939
01:21:57,634 --> 01:21:59,669
Roy's gone. We're all that's left.

940
01:22:00,153 --> 01:22:01,671
<i>It's up to us now.</i>

941
01:22:01,972 --> 01:22:03,580
Driver halt!

942
01:22:03,907 --> 01:22:06,059
Gordo, get around him.
Put us on his backside.

943
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,845
<i>If we get behind him, we can kill him.
Go! Go! Go!</i>

944
01:22:10,313 --> 01:22:11,974
Reverse reverse!

945
01:22:12,074 --> 01:22:14,151
Don't let him behind us!

946
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:15,685
Faster, Gordo!

947
01:22:18,463 --> 01:22:19,647
God damn it!

948
01:22:21,433 --> 01:22:23,025
Forward

949
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:27,146
Target 2 o'clock!

950
01:22:28,932 --> 01:22:31,376
- God damn it! Fuck!
- What was that?

951
01:22:31,476 --> 01:22:32,711
- We got hit!
- I lost it.

952
01:22:32,811 --> 01:22:33,837
Boyd, are you all right?

953
01:22:33,937 --> 01:22:34,880
- Shit!
- Fuck!

954
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,423
We lost power traverse.
Switching to manual.

955
01:22:36,523 --> 01:22:37,757
Boyd, you stay in the fight!

956
01:22:37,857 --> 01:22:39,501
- Bible, hit him!<i>
- On the way!</i>

957
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,262
Coming around! He's coming around!

958
01:22:42,362 --> 01:22:43,680
<i>Gordo, you got to outrun that gun!</i>

959
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:46,216
- Oh, I got it! I got it!
- Fire!

960
01:22:46,992 --> 01:22:49,511
<i>Gordo, put it in third. Right stick!</i>

961
01:22:51,413 --> 01:22:53,607
Bible, put it up his ass,
where the armor's thin.

962
01:22:53,707 --> 01:22:54,816
I know where to fucking hit him!

963
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:57,227
- Boyd, you're clear!
- On the way!

964
01:22:58,295 --> 01:23:00,947
- Shit!<i>
- God damn it, I said in the ass!</i>

965
01:23:01,047 --> 01:23:02,799
We're moving too fast!
It's not that fucking easy!

966
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:04,117
Come on, Boyd, stay on him!

967
01:23:04,217 --> 01:23:06,369
Gordo, when I say back up,
you back up. Left stick.

968
01:23:06,469 --> 01:23:07,570
All right, all right.

969
01:23:08,013 --> 01:23:10,907
- Bible, stand by. I'll call the shot.
- Roger! Roger!

970
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:15,704
Gordo, now! Reverse!
Reverse! Left stick!

971
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:19,374
Bible, steady.

972
01:23:20,817 --> 01:23:22,085
<i>Steady.</i>

973
01:23:22,302 --> 01:23:23,553
Shoot the bastard!

974
01:23:23,653 --> 01:23:25,889
- Come on, Bible!
- Come on, fucking shoot him!

975
01:23:25,989 --> 01:23:27,257
Steady.

976
01:23:30,635 --> 01:23:32,053
- Now!
- On the way!

977
01:23:36,374 --> 01:23:38,109
Fuck! Grady, one more! One more, Grady!

978
01:23:38,209 --> 01:23:39,569
- Grady, Grady, Grady!
- Clear!

979
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:41,479
- Again!
- On the way!

980
01:23:47,177 --> 01:23:48,411
Clear!

981
01:23:48,511 --> 01:23:50,030
- Tank destroyed.<i>
- Gordo, halt.</i>

982
01:23:51,389 --> 01:23:52,490
Jesus Christ.

983
01:23:59,397 --> 01:24:01,249
Fucking Nazi fuck!

984
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:05,628
Fuck you!

985
01:24:34,224 --> 01:24:36,459
Radio check, Love 1-6.

986
01:24:37,018 --> 01:24:38,411
Yeah, boy.

987
01:24:39,771 --> 01:24:43,524
Radio check, Love 1-6.
Fucking handed him.

988
01:24:45,235 --> 01:24:47,837
- Good fucking job, Gordo.
- Radio check, Love 1-6.

989
01:24:49,614 --> 01:24:51,841
Radio check, Love 1-6.

990
01:24:55,996 --> 01:24:59,290
Radio's eighty-sixed. We're on our own.

991
01:25:08,925 --> 01:25:10,110
Good shot.

992
01:25:11,052 --> 01:25:14,698
It wasn't me. No, no,
I'm the instrument, not the hand.

993
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,378
God didn't call us today.
You hear me, boys?

994
01:25:20,478 --> 01:25:22,455
What's he doing up there?

995
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:25,208
Big pair of dice?

996
01:25:26,776 --> 01:25:29,587
Everyone else came up snake eyes but us?

997
01:25:29,863 --> 01:25:31,865
- Lord's protection.
- We got it, don't we, Boyd?

998
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:33,758
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- We got it.

999
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,896
Norman mowed them fuckers down,
didn't he, too?

1000
01:25:37,996 --> 01:25:40,565
- Good job, Norman.
- Welcome to the Army, Norm.

1001
01:25:40,665 --> 01:25:42,225
You did good.

1002
01:25:45,754 --> 01:25:48,898
- Best job I ever had.
- Best job I ever had.

1003
01:25:49,299 --> 01:25:51,109
Best job I ever had.

1004
01:25:54,387 --> 01:25:56,656
Best job I ever had.

1005
01:25:57,349 --> 01:25:58,616
Shit.

1006
01:26:01,019 --> 01:26:05,173
We're still open for business.
Let's head out for those crossroads,

1007
01:26:05,273 --> 01:26:07,709
keep it out of Krauts' hands
like we've been told.

1008
01:26:07,943 --> 01:26:11,504
There's a wave coming in.
We're the rock to break that wave.

1009
01:26:13,783 --> 01:26:14,634
<i>Vámonos!</i>

1010
01:26:16,618 --> 01:26:17,969
Gordo, get us out of here.

1011
01:26:19,204 --> 01:26:20,722
Fuck it.

1012
01:26:40,183 --> 01:26:42,127
All right, there's the crossroads.

1013
01:26:42,227 --> 01:26:45,163
Gordo, take us up on that hill.
We can cover the whole valley from there.

1014
01:26:54,481 --> 01:26:56,132
Grady, get down!

1015
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:04,107
Shit! Not another fucking Tiger!

1016
01:27:04,207 --> 01:27:05,497
- A mine.
- Where?

1017
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:08,436
Settle down. It's a mine.
We hit a mine, is all.

1018
01:27:09,504 --> 01:27:11,698
- Everybody off. Grady?
- Yeah, I'm off.

1019
01:27:11,798 --> 01:27:13,316
Shit.

1020
01:27:14,593 --> 01:27:15,994
How bad is it?

1021
01:27:16,094 --> 01:27:19,414
It's broke as fuck. Busted a bogie, too.

1022
01:27:19,514 --> 01:27:21,190
Can you fix it?

1023
01:27:21,391 --> 01:27:23,201
Yeah, why not?

1024
01:27:23,301 --> 01:27:25,555
<i>Ha estado pegada, no?</i>

1025
01:27:26,314 --> 01:27:28,697
<i>'tas bien maldita, mamá.</i>

1026
01:27:29,187 --> 01:27:31,301
<i>Necesitan unos chacos y todo.</i>

1027
01:27:31,401 --> 01:27:33,595
All right, Norman, you and
Coon-Ass check out that building.

1028
01:27:33,695 --> 01:27:35,972
- Get my Thompson.
- What?

1029
01:27:36,072 --> 01:27:37,182
Go get the Thompson.

1030
01:27:37,282 --> 01:27:38,975
- Gordo!
- Yeah?

1031
01:27:39,075 --> 01:27:41,386
- You got that rope bag?
- Right here.

1032
01:28:09,481 --> 01:28:13,551
You can put the gun down, Norman.
Ain't gonna do nothing.

1033
01:28:22,202 --> 01:28:23,845
Can we go now?

1034
01:28:26,748 --> 01:28:28,892
Norman, I'm sorry. You know?

1035
01:28:30,794 --> 01:28:32,604
I think...

1036
01:28:33,797 --> 01:28:36,199
I think you're a good man.

1037
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,568
It's what I think.

1038
01:28:41,346 --> 01:28:44,749
I think maybe we ain't,
but I think you are.

1039
01:28:44,849 --> 01:28:48,703
See, I just... I wanted
to tell you that.

1040
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,507
It's okay.

1041
01:28:55,902 --> 01:28:57,712
Come on, let's go.

1042
01:29:00,448 --> 01:29:02,625
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

1043
01:29:02,742 --> 01:29:05,870
It's an aid station. They all dead.

1044
01:29:09,824 --> 01:29:10,850
Kid.

1045
01:29:14,254 --> 01:29:16,981
Head up top of that hill, near those trees.
You got outpost guard.

1046
01:29:17,841 --> 01:29:19,776
Can I grab my canteen?

1047
01:29:20,302 --> 01:29:22,654
Yeah, you can grab your canteen.

1048
01:29:37,277 --> 01:29:38,420
Norman!

1049
01:29:39,195 --> 01:29:41,798
Top of the hill, then work
your way from the trees.

1050
01:32:12,557 --> 01:32:15,560
Hey! Hey!

1051
01:32:17,787 --> 01:32:20,298
Good evening, Norman. Why aren't
you at your post? Slow down.

1052
01:32:20,398 --> 01:32:22,425
- They're coming right now.
- Who's coming?

1053
01:32:22,525 --> 01:32:24,961
- The Germans!
- How many?

1054
01:32:25,195 --> 01:32:27,589
- Too many. Too many to count.
- How many?

1055
01:32:28,198 --> 01:32:31,434
About two, maybe 300 of them.

1056
01:32:31,534 --> 01:32:33,061
They got vehicles, too.

1057
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:35,021
- Tanks?
- No, no, no, just trucks.

1058
01:32:35,121 --> 01:32:37,107
Probably a bunch of bums
looking to surrender, that's all.

1059
01:32:37,207 --> 01:32:39,476
No. No, no, no.
They were marching, they were singing.

1060
01:32:39,576 --> 01:32:40,527
They sounded like they wanted a fight.

1061
01:32:40,627 --> 01:32:44,314
- What do you mean, they were singing?
- I'm telling you. Right over there.

1062
01:32:47,259 --> 01:32:49,119
Hey, you hear that?

1063
01:32:49,219 --> 01:32:51,913
- It's a goddamn SS battalion.
- Bullshit.

1064
01:32:52,013 --> 01:32:53,740
Jesus Christ.

1065
01:32:55,183 --> 01:32:57,002
- Grady, get my gun.
- Yeah.

1066
01:32:57,102 --> 01:32:58,670
- You want to get your weapon?
- Shit.

1067
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:00,589
- What do you want to do?
- Let's just get our shit, all right?

1068
01:33:00,689 --> 01:33:03,842
Look, it's about to be dark.
We just get on up out of here, huh?

1069
01:33:03,942 --> 01:33:05,677
- Let 'em pass on through.
- Let's him them woods.

1070
01:33:05,777 --> 01:33:08,880
Norman, go get your shit.
Go get your pack.

1071
01:33:09,573 --> 01:33:11,299
Let's go.

1072
01:33:12,409 --> 01:33:14,311
We never run before,
I ain't running now.

1073
01:33:14,411 --> 01:33:16,438
- What was that?
- We're gonna fight it out.

1074
01:33:16,538 --> 01:33:18,899
- We can't.
- I'm gonna hold this crossroad.

1075
01:33:18,999 --> 01:33:21,818
What you mean, you're gonna hold...
The tank's busted!

1076
01:33:21,918 --> 01:33:23,820
- The tank's fucking busted, Top!
- Hey.

1077
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,405
- Yeah, you said that.
- Top, what are you doing?

1078
01:33:25,505 --> 01:33:26,740
What do you want to do?
You want to sit here?

1079
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:27,991
- I'm gonna hold this crossroad.
- You want to sit here

1080
01:33:28,091 --> 01:33:29,075
and hold off a SS battalion...

1081
01:33:29,175 --> 01:33:30,660
No, it's not what I want to do,
but it's what we're doing.

1082
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,704
- There's five of us...
- Get to your fighting positions! Mount up!

1083
01:33:32,804 --> 01:33:35,957
What you mean fucking fighting positions
when we ain't got a tank? How we gonna fight?

1084
01:33:36,057 --> 01:33:38,168
- We got a cannon!
- Don, that don't make sense!

1085
01:33:38,268 --> 01:33:40,870
Stop! What are you doing?

1086
01:33:55,368 --> 01:33:57,512
Get out of here. Get to that tree line.

1087
01:34:05,086 --> 01:34:08,423
Boys, take care of yourselves.
Get to that tree line.

1088
01:34:17,265 --> 01:34:19,025
It's all right.

1089
01:34:22,312 --> 01:34:24,239
It's all right.

1090
01:34:26,983 --> 01:34:28,743
It's my home.

1091
01:34:45,585 --> 01:34:47,929
I'm staying here with you.

1092
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:56,204
All right. I'll need you to load.

1093
01:34:58,431 --> 01:35:01,509
Boys, get on. It's all right.

1094
01:35:03,186 --> 01:35:05,271
Grady, come on.

1095
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:10,919
We're gonna stay.

1096
01:35:16,908 --> 01:35:18,677
What is your plan?

1097
01:35:32,132 --> 01:35:33,683
Fuck it.

1098
01:35:37,554 --> 01:35:39,239
Get us one of them dead Krauts.

1099
01:36:09,601 --> 01:36:11,038
Light him up.

1100
01:36:32,317 --> 01:36:34,136
You wanna take that kit
right there. That's it.

1101
01:36:34,236 --> 01:36:38,006
- Go and grab it. That's it.
- All right, all right.

1102
01:36:38,615 --> 01:36:39,599
Grease gun.

1103
01:36:39,699 --> 01:36:41,518
- Go on, hand it to him.
- Another box.

1104
01:36:41,618 --> 01:36:44,646
Go ahead and get it ready.
Listen, you do not waste one shot.

1105
01:36:44,746 --> 01:36:46,022
- You hear me?
- Gordo.

1106
01:36:46,122 --> 01:36:47,440
- Grenades.
- Ammo count.

1107
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:49,609
- Put that there.
- Make them count.

1108
01:36:49,709 --> 01:36:52,154
What kind of rounds you
got up there? Norm?

1109
01:36:52,254 --> 01:36:53,488
- I only got two.
- All right.

1110
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:55,231
Ready?

1111
01:36:55,465 --> 01:36:56,775
That's it. Yeah.

1112
01:36:58,593 --> 01:37:00,653
I'm going through ammo like water.

1113
01:37:00,971 --> 01:37:05,375
That's four rounds of smoke,
and 23 super charge and 33 solid shot.

1114
01:37:05,475 --> 01:37:08,495
- What you want, Top?
- Load super charge. Set the point delay.

1115
01:37:09,187 --> 01:37:11,080
Norman, get it ready.

1116
01:37:15,652 --> 01:37:18,029
That's it. Here we go, Boyd.

1117
01:37:21,449 --> 01:37:23,093
Gordo, grab me that one.

1118
01:37:28,957 --> 01:37:30,600
- Boyd.
- Thank you.

1119
01:37:30,834 --> 01:37:32,686
Give me that can.

1120
01:37:48,893 --> 01:37:53,123
Might as well get a little tight.
Won't be around for the hangover.

1121
01:38:13,084 --> 01:38:15,437
God, that's better than good.

1122
01:38:21,134 --> 01:38:22,694
Give it here.

1123
01:38:28,099 --> 01:38:29,659
Give it here.

1124
01:38:34,898 --> 01:38:37,792
- What you gonna do with that?
- I'm gonna drink it.

1125
01:38:39,236 --> 01:38:42,222
I know you hate me preaching.
I know it.

1126
01:38:42,322 --> 01:38:44,716
But what we're doing here
is a righteous act, gentlemen.

1127
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,885
You hear me, Gordo?

1128
01:38:52,082 --> 01:38:55,726
You know, there's a Bible verse
I think about sometimes.

1129
01:38:56,962 --> 01:38:58,938
Many times.

1130
01:38:59,256 --> 01:39:00,815
It goes...

1131
01:39:02,259 --> 01:39:05,520
"Then I heard the voice
of the Lord saying,

1132
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:09,432
"'Whom shall I send?
And who will go for us?'

1133
01:39:19,192 --> 01:39:22,328
"And I said,

1134
01:39:22,904 --> 01:39:24,906
"'Here am I.

1135
01:39:26,366 --> 01:39:28,351
"'Send me.'"

1136
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:36,793
"'Send me.'"

1137
01:39:38,336 --> 01:39:41,014
Book of Isaiah, Chapter Six.

1138
01:39:49,598 --> 01:39:52,733
Yeah. Yeah, Don.

1139
01:39:53,852 --> 01:39:56,413
That's exactly right. Oh, wow.

1140
01:39:57,689 --> 01:39:58,790
You're something.

1141
01:40:18,585 --> 01:40:20,795
God damn, son.

1142
01:40:20,962 --> 01:40:24,024
You a fighting, fucking,
drinking machine, ain't you?

1143
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:26,776
Machine, that's it, that's his war name.

1144
01:40:27,177 --> 01:40:28,486
That's perfect.

1145
01:40:29,179 --> 01:40:30,822
I christen thee "Machine."

1146
01:40:32,349 --> 01:40:33,875
- Machine!
- Machine!

1147
01:40:33,975 --> 01:40:35,043
Machine!

1148
01:40:35,143 --> 01:40:36,619
- Machine!
- Yeah.

1149
01:40:38,605 --> 01:40:40,240
Machine.

1150
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:45,086
I love it in here.

1151
01:40:45,695 --> 01:40:47,472
I do.

1152
01:40:48,531 --> 01:40:51,893
- Best job I ever had.
- Best fucking job.

1153
01:40:55,038 --> 01:40:56,598
Yeah.

1154
01:41:05,882 --> 01:41:07,384
They're coming.

1155
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:16,159
No one makes a move unless I say.

1156
01:41:16,768 --> 01:41:19,449
Come on, you cocksuckers, come on in.

1157
01:41:44,588 --> 01:41:45,730
Come on in.

1158
01:41:52,304 --> 01:41:53,780
Almost.

1159
01:42:00,895 --> 01:42:02,872
Come on in. Hey, come on.

1160
01:42:18,538 --> 01:42:19,681
Now!

1161
01:42:23,126 --> 01:42:25,278
Like that, motherfuckers?

1162
01:42:25,378 --> 01:42:26,738
- Clear!
- Fire!

1163
01:42:26,838 --> 01:42:28,023
On the way!

1164
01:42:30,342 --> 01:42:32,268
- Clear!
- On the way!

1165
01:42:47,609 --> 01:42:50,327
Fucking Nazi. Fuck!

1166
01:42:53,156 --> 01:42:54,599
They're running! They're running!
Traverse left!

1167
01:42:54,699 --> 01:42:56,893
Bow gunner, squirt those
assholes running for that mill.

1168
01:42:56,993 --> 01:42:58,870
Cut those fuckers down!

1169
01:43:00,956 --> 01:43:02,566
Loader, four rounds of Willy Pete.

1170
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:04,484
Bible, put it in that building.
It's full of fucking Krauts.

1171
01:43:04,584 --> 01:43:05,861
- Clear!
- Fire! Fire!

1172
01:43:05,961 --> 01:43:07,228
On the way!

1173
01:43:10,507 --> 01:43:12,225
Give me another. That was beautiful.

1174
01:43:12,759 --> 01:43:14,778
- You clear!
- On the way!

1175
01:43:16,346 --> 01:43:19,115
- Bow gunner, watch that left!
- Yeah, you better fucking run.

1176
01:43:28,358 --> 01:43:29,626
Traverse right!

1177
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:34,306
On the way!

1178
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:39,186
- Bible, stay on 'em. 15 up, 15 up.
- Fire!

1179
01:43:39,286 --> 01:43:40,720
- Clear!
- On the way!

1180
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:48,678
Traverse right! Doughs, two o'clock!
Give 'em a big kick in the butt!

1181
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,572
All right, I'm on them.

1182
01:43:50,672 --> 01:43:52,515
- You're clear!
- On the way!

1183
01:43:52,882 --> 01:43:56,344
Loader, give me another point delay.
Skip it on the ground. Bounce those fuckers!

1184
01:43:58,013 --> 01:43:59,698
- Clear!
- On the way!

1185
01:44:01,725 --> 01:44:02,951
Come on!

1186
01:44:06,104 --> 01:44:07,247
Hit 'em again!

1187
01:44:07,689 --> 01:44:08,882
Go, boys! Go, boys!

1188
01:44:08,982 --> 01:44:11,292
Grady, Grady, Grady,
Grady, Grady, come on, now.

1189
01:44:11,568 --> 01:44:12,803
- Clear!
- Light 'em up!

1190
01:44:12,903 --> 01:44:14,087
On the way!

1191
01:44:15,405 --> 01:44:17,181
Down 15. Steady.

1192
01:44:17,449 --> 01:44:18,550
Traverse left!

1193
01:44:20,118 --> 01:44:21,561
- You clear!
- Fire at will!

1194
01:44:21,661 --> 01:44:22,762
On the way!

1195
01:44:24,456 --> 01:44:26,299
That's right, burn to
the fucking ground.

1196
01:44:30,462 --> 01:44:31,888
Machine, clock one!

1197
01:44:37,969 --> 01:44:39,037
I'm out!

1198
01:44:39,137 --> 01:44:41,414
- I need a new can!
- Shoot, we out! We out!

1199
01:44:41,514 --> 01:44:44,692
Fuck. We got a case rupture.
This gun is gone.

1200
01:44:44,809 --> 01:44:47,128
- We need more boxes of ammo!
- We got .30 on the roof.

1201
01:44:47,228 --> 01:44:50,531
All right, we got ammo outside.
I'm gonna lay down some smokes.

1202
01:44:51,107 --> 01:44:53,677
Gordo, on my signal, pop your hatch,
lay down some cover fire.

1203
01:44:53,777 --> 01:44:55,011
- Okay, roger.
- Machine, you do the same.

1204
01:44:55,111 --> 01:44:56,346
- Grab that grease gun.
- Copy.

1205
01:44:56,446 --> 01:44:58,807
Cover right!
Bible, get ready to snatch that .30.

1206
01:44:58,907 --> 01:45:00,091
Roger.

1207
01:45:20,387 --> 01:45:22,105
All right, here we go.

1208
01:45:26,351 --> 01:45:27,494
Go!

1209
01:45:37,304 --> 01:45:39,288
They're outside the tank!
Pick them off!

1210
01:45:44,369 --> 01:45:45,595
Come on, Boyd!

1211
01:45:47,122 --> 01:45:48,431
Take it, Grady.

1212
01:45:53,598 --> 01:45:54,918
<i>Chinga tu madre!</i>

1213
01:46:05,999 --> 01:46:07,167
Move up!

1214
01:46:07,267 --> 01:46:08,493
Button up!

1215
01:46:28,496 --> 01:46:29,648
Quick, quick, quick!

1216
01:46:29,748 --> 01:46:31,474
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Hurry up, Grady!

1217
01:46:40,717 --> 01:46:43,853
- Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck!
- Shoot him, Bible!

1218
01:46:59,236 --> 01:47:02,839
- Gord? Gordo?
- Grady, I need two more.

1219
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:05,934
- I got two left.
- They're getting cocky.

1220
01:47:06,034 --> 01:47:08,545
Fuckers. He's hit.

1221
01:47:09,829 --> 01:47:11,481
Damn sure ain't no good
leaking oil everywhere.

1222
01:47:11,581 --> 01:47:13,383
So patch me up, then.

1223
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:15,635
Hey, take these two boxes.
Put 'em down below.

1224
01:47:15,961 --> 01:47:17,445
Hey, Grady, come on. Keep it coming.

1225
01:47:17,545 --> 01:47:19,722
All right. Open the other one for me.

1226
01:47:22,801 --> 01:47:27,080
If a man loves the world,
the love of the father's not in him.

1227
01:47:28,932 --> 01:47:30,909
For all that's in the world,

1228
01:47:31,142 --> 01:47:35,872
lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes,
pride of life

1229
01:47:36,439 --> 01:47:39,292
it's not of the father.
It's of the world.

1230
01:47:40,068 --> 01:47:42,045
The world and its desires pass away.

1231
01:47:43,113 --> 01:47:44,964
But he who does God's will
is gonna live forever.

1232
01:47:45,073 --> 01:47:46,424
Forever.

1233
01:47:59,045 --> 01:48:00,522
Lift it up.

1234
01:48:05,444 --> 01:48:07,536
Swarm and kill them!

1235
01:48:08,571 --> 01:48:12,107
Make them count!
They're all we have

1236
01:48:33,788 --> 01:48:36,558
Save your ammo. Don't shoot
unless you see something.

1237
01:48:37,167 --> 01:48:38,735
We can be damn sure they're
working their way behind us.

1238
01:48:38,835 --> 01:48:40,529
- Anybody see anything?
- I see nothing.

1239
01:48:40,629 --> 01:48:42,255
- I got nothing.
- Nothing.

1240
01:48:42,456 --> 01:48:44,482
Advance, advance quickly

1241
01:48:49,596 --> 01:48:50,864
Panzerfaust, four o'clock!

1242
01:48:52,349 --> 01:48:53,491
Traverse right!

1243
01:48:55,393 --> 01:48:57,370
- He missed!
- Hit him with the coax!

1244
01:49:05,862 --> 01:49:07,047
Fuck!

1245
01:49:16,331 --> 01:49:17,974
Grady. Hey.

1246
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:22,112
Fuck! Fuck!

1247
01:49:22,212 --> 01:49:25,606
No. No. No.

1248
01:49:27,384 --> 01:49:29,310
No. No.

1249
01:49:30,595 --> 01:49:32,346
God.

1250
01:49:33,223 --> 01:49:37,201
- Hey, Grady...
- Get up! We're still in this fight!

1251
01:49:38,653 --> 01:49:40,563
We're still in this fight!

1252
01:49:43,567 --> 01:49:45,869
Watch our right, watch our right.

1253
01:49:49,322 --> 01:49:51,007
Stay on the .30. Keep hammering them.

1254
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:07,982
Yeah, you motherfuckers! Come on.

1255
01:50:14,431 --> 01:50:16,557
How long can we keep this up?

1256
01:50:17,559 --> 01:50:20,636
- Come on, keep shooting!
- Fuck, I'm out! I'm out!

1257
01:50:20,812 --> 01:50:23,340
- I need a new can!
- That was our last belt.

1258
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:24,941
She's out!

1259
01:50:26,318 --> 01:50:27,627
That's all there is.

1260
01:50:28,445 --> 01:50:29,513
Fuck!

1261
01:50:29,613 --> 01:50:31,848
- Fuck.
- Don't get your panties in a bunch.

1262
01:50:31,948 --> 01:50:34,009
We still got hand weapons and the .50.

1263
01:50:38,163 --> 01:50:39,589
Who's with me?

1264
01:50:41,691 --> 01:50:44,226
They're running low on ammunition!

1265
01:50:44,761 --> 01:50:47,271
Finish them!

1266
01:50:48,031 --> 01:50:49,667
This is our land!

1267
01:50:49,767 --> 01:50:51,233
Attention!

1268
01:50:51,444 --> 01:50:52,526
Move out!

1269
01:51:03,229 --> 01:51:04,981
Gordo?

1270
01:51:06,691 --> 01:51:08,484
Machine!

1271
01:51:44,688 --> 01:51:46,364
Where the hell are they?

1272
01:51:48,275 --> 01:51:49,959
They're everywhere.

1273
01:52:15,927 --> 01:52:18,863
Fuck! Fuck, I'm out!

1274
01:52:19,389 --> 01:52:21,390
Gun's gone! I need a weapon!

1275
01:52:21,725 --> 01:52:23,409
Bible, no!

1276
01:52:56,593 --> 01:52:58,028
Grenade!

1277
01:53:22,827 --> 01:53:24,846
Go! Come on!

1278
01:53:32,545 --> 01:53:33,780
What the fuck are you doing?

1279
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:35,557
- Button up!
- I'm sorry!

1280
01:53:36,466 --> 01:53:37,901
I'm sorry.

1281
01:53:40,211 --> 01:53:41,337
Smoke grenades, now!

1282
01:54:06,271 --> 01:54:08,598
We're going to skin you alive!

1283
01:54:09,666 --> 01:54:13,466
Shut up and send me more pigs to kill!

1284
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:21,653
Fuck you!

1285
01:54:25,348 --> 01:54:26,816
Bible, grenades!

1286
01:54:30,895 --> 01:54:32,163
Here, take...

1287
01:56:44,237 --> 01:56:46,306
I'm sorry, son.

1288
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,036
It's okay.

1289
01:56:53,622 --> 01:56:55,648
What can you do?

1290
01:57:09,512 --> 01:57:11,539
I did my best.

1291
01:57:12,641 --> 01:57:17,019
Yeah. I know. I know.

1292
01:57:30,116 --> 01:57:32,143
Sergeant Collier?

1293
01:57:32,911 --> 01:57:35,096
Yeah, son?

1294
01:57:41,753 --> 01:57:43,921
I'm scared.

1295
01:57:46,967 --> 01:57:49,177
I'm scared, too.

1296
01:57:58,645 --> 01:58:00,872
Oh, Jesus.

1297
01:58:01,606 --> 01:58:04,417
Oh, fuck, I want to surrender.

1298
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:08,504
Please don't.

1299
01:58:09,364 --> 01:58:12,700
- They'll hurt you real bad.
- Oh, fuck.

1300
01:58:14,077 --> 01:58:16,629
And they'll kill you real bad.

1301
01:58:18,582 --> 01:58:20,900
Fuck, what do I do?

1302
01:58:22,627 --> 01:58:24,654
There's a hatch.

1303
01:58:24,921 --> 01:58:26,748
Okay. Okay.

1304
01:58:26,881 --> 01:58:28,950
- Do you see it?
- I see it.

1305
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:31,152
- You know where it is?
- I know where it is.

1306
01:58:42,272 --> 01:58:43,665
What the fuck?

1307
01:58:51,114 --> 01:58:52,424
Go.

1308
02:03:23,261 --> 02:03:25,139
Easy, boy.

1309
02:03:26,014 --> 02:03:27,449
Easy, now.

1310
02:03:28,224 --> 02:03:30,201
One's alive!

1311
02:03:48,119 --> 02:03:50,805
Easy. Easy, buddy.

1312
02:03:51,081 --> 02:03:52,399
Come on.

1313
02:03:52,499 --> 02:03:54,776
All right, there we go. Okay.

1314
02:03:54,876 --> 02:03:59,030
- You all right? You hit? You hurt?
- I'm...

1315
02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:01,191
You seem all right. Let me take this.

1316
02:04:02,592 --> 02:04:04,578
We'll leave you with that.

1317
02:04:04,678 --> 02:04:07,263
Hey, you're a hero, buddy.

1318
02:04:07,942 --> 02:04:09,763
Do you know that?
